This C# console application synchronizes files and directories between a source and a replica folder at a user-defined interval. It accepts four command-line arguments:
1.	Source folder path
2.	Replica folder path
3.	Synchronization interval
4.	Log folder path
The program configures the source and replica folders, sets the synchronization interval, and specifies the log folder. It then lists all files and directories before starting an asynchronous loop to continuously synchronize the folders according to the specified interval.
